# TotalPollBot
Welcome to my TotalPoll bot.  This project is not intended to be used with
malicious intentions and is only a simple reverse engineering of a popular
WordPress plugin.  Keep in mind that the only reason this works is because
TotalPoll uses cookies to keep track of users that already voted.  However,
the plugin does offer the ability to block users by IP address after they
have voted once already.  I take no responsibility for nefarious usage of
this bot as it only created for educational purposes.
and ths boat created for good thinks.
